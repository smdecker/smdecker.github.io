Essentially I feel like its about building a space for things that you want to see exist in the world. As someone that has made creative work to exist on the internet (and have many peers that also do the same) I have been compelled to have a greater stake in how these things live online. The web seems to be a place at which many things enter the world for the first time and while some of these things seek to be shared and seen by the largest possible audience, there are some things that seek an environment with greater context that can somehow thrive beyond the seen-shared ecosystem where your creative labor online fuels ad revenue. The tools are available to change things. I believe that by learning how to program and understand the infrastructure and interconnectedness of the web is the first step to realizing the vast potential of how we exist online and the deeper connections of how this impacts our daily lives.
